# Whooo


##Terry's World

Wooo! You know you can't bring that weak ass stuff up in this humpy-bumpy!

You kill the joe, you make some mo'! You know that baby!

Else you in for a long day, a long day! Coz Triple T's up in this biiiitch!

Break was over 15 minutes ago, Mitch!

I am an enforcer man. Don't nothing go down in my house. It's 100% heart, baby.

Sure I check a few fools. I give 'em the pain. But sometimes it's about intimidation you know. It's mind games.

Get ready for the pain woman. The pain train's comin'. Woo-woo! Woo-woo!

Terry: You know you need a cover sheet on your TPS reports, Richard! That ain't new, baby!
Woman: Hey Terry.
Terry [to woman]: Hey Janice.
Terry [to Richard]: Motherfu-

That's a long distance call, Doug!

Playin' hurt? Baby, that don't phase me! I don't got time for pain. The only pain I got time for is the pain I put on fools who don't know what time it is!

Any bitch-ass think I'da lost a step, 'cause of what happened? 'Cause what happened to my knee and such?? Well he in for a surprise. A rude, painful surprise!

Whoo-baby-yeah!

I just do my job man. I do what my God-given abilities allow me to do and I thank Jesus Christ for it every single day. And do I enjoy what I do? [Chuckles] Hell, yeah.


##Draft Day

You got mail baby, wooo!

Timmy Timmy Timmy. You can't come up in here dressed like that son. This ain't Club Med baby...

Wassup y'all? Daaamn!

That ain't your cake, Phillip, that's Simone's cake. You eat someone else's cake again, and I will get you a slice of Terry's very special pain cake. And you won't want seconds o' that.


##Office Athlete Of The Century

You can't hurt this! I'm a machine, G! I'm built for this, son! Whoo! Whoo!

You respect the arts, or the arts won't respect you! Your ass trapped in my box now, baby, Terry's pantomime box of pain! And there ain't no escape from that! Whooo!

Whooo! You can't walk away from a K-22 paper jam! You must be out of your mind, son! This is my world, Donnie, you just work here baby!

Look man, there ain't no secret to success in business or in life! The solution is simple, baby! One hundred percent heart, all day, everyday. Only quitters quit, and Triple T is a hitter, not a quitter. Believe that.

You can't be tippy toe...up in here! Whooo!


##Vacation

Look man, fun is fun. Ain't no problem with chillin', when the chillin's right. But when things ain't happenin' the way they supposed to happen, you know Triple T gonna condense the nonsense. Just because I'm on vacation, don't mean I'm out to lunch - I come to play, baby!

Damn!................. Justin, I ordered those eggs, forty minutes ago! Don't make me scramble you again, son.

You can run, but you can't hide, baby!

You wanna play games Gene? Well Terry's back, and I got a new game for you! It's called "How Much Pain Can Gene Stand, Before Gene Learns Not To Play Games Anymore". That's my game, that's Terry's game, and when it's game time, it's pain time, baby. Whoo!


##The Streaker

You just did it, so I had to hit it! Whooo! Wo-whoo!


##Sensitivity Training

You must be out of your mind, son! You can't cut the cheese, where ever you please! That's just nasty!

Eat that candy again, and I'm gonna lay a smack attack on that candy ass that you won't eva snap back from again! B****!

Sensitivity trainin'? Hahahaha... Hey man, I'm a sensitive motherf***er.

My tacklin' knows no race, gender, or creed! So bring it on!

I'm an equal opportunity hitting machine, all day, everyday, believe that.

Special bubble! This woman can't come in mah house and tell Triple T that he has trouble with the special bubble!

Look man, playing out of position, that ain't Terry's game. You can take the fish out the sea, but you ain't eva gonna take the linebacker outta me. Believe that.

Um...Roger, may I have your permission to initiate physical contact upon your person?

Whoo! You can't make a pass, and pinch Pablo's ass! That's old school rules baby. Whooo!

This ain't your home, so don't use the speakerphone, Roger! Whooo!
